# html_page-blog
This is a page that I created after completing my Html+Css course on "SOLOLEARN".
This repository contains:
1.htmlblog.html(sorry for the name)--
Contains the entire html code linked with css file.Also has a link to a motivational video of mine.At the footer part,it contains a link to the "SOLOLEARN" website and another link to my "GITHUB" repository.
2.abc.css--
Contains the css styles, which is in-turn linked to the html file.
